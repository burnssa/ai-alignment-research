Reed framework; (3) Privacy/liberty justification accurately quotes language that appears in the opinion. The main issue is that due_process should not be 0.0 since the Fourteenth Amendment framework necessarily invokes both clauses, and the Griswold analysis referenced throughout is fundamentally a due process case. The privacy discussion is substantial enough that it might warrant slightly higher weighting than 0.5, as Eisenstadt is primarily remembered for extending Griswold's privacy principle to unmarried persons."

The opinion explicitly centers on the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and applies heightened scrutiny ('exceedingly persuasive justification') to sex-based classifications. The justification correctly identifies this focus. The excerpt shows Justice Ginsburg repeatedly discussing equal protection analysis, Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan precedent, and the unconstitutionality of Virginia's male-only admissions policy at VMI. Free expression, federalism, and privacy/liberty are indeed not material principles in this opinion - the case is purely about equal protection and sex discrimination. The only minor consideration is that Fourteenth Amendment cases sometimes implicate both Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses, and educational opportunity could tangentially touch due process liberty interests, but this is minimal in the actual opinion text. The 1.0 weight on equal protection is defensible and nearly optimal."

This case is definitionally about procedural due process - the entire opinion revolves around what process is 'due' before welfare benefits can be terminated. The Court explicitly frames the question as 'whether a State that terminates public assistance payments...without affording him the opportunity for an evidentiary hearing prior to termination denies the recipient procedural due process.' The quoted justification accurately captures the Court's emphasis. Equal protection is correctly weighted at 0.0 - this is not about discrimination between classes. Free expression (0.0) and privacy/liberty (0.0) are also correctly weighted as these issues are not engaged. The only minor consideration is that the case does involve some discussion of state action and federally-assisted state programs, which could warrant a minimal federalism weight (perhaps 0.05), but this is so secondary to the due process analysis that 0.0 is defensible. The 1.0 weight for due process is entirely appropriate."

Privacy provides the normative foundation but is not the operational focus of the holding."

      "verification_notes": "The extracted quotes are accurate and appear in the opinion. The weights are generally reasonable, but the relationship between due process and privacy could be better calibrated. Due process deserves equal or slightly higher weight than privacy because it's the doctrinal vehicle for the entire holding - the Court is determining what due process requires, using Fourth Amendment privacy protections as the substantive content. Federalism at 0.5 is appropriate given the opinion's significant discussion of federal-state relations and the rejection of Wolf's approach that allowed states different standards.

The main adjustment needed is rebalancing federalism vs. privacy_liberty: federalism is discussed but quickly subordinated, while the bodily integrity violation is the factual basis that makes this conduct constitutionally shocking.

The justifications provided are accurate quotes that do appear in the opinion. However, the opinion is fundamentally about balancing state regulatory interests against individual liberty, making federalism more significant than weighted.

The Court explicitly holds that privacy interests are NOT substantially invaded here ('persons confronted...could effectively avoid further bombardment of their sensibilities simply by averting their eyes').

The quote provided ('The constitutional right of free expression is powerful medicine...') accurately appears in the opinion.

The opinion focuses on: (1) whether Cohen's speech falls into unprotected categories (obscenity, fighting words); (2) whether the manner restriction is valid; and (3) whether unwilling audience exposure justifies regulation. All of these are core free expression issues. The privacy discussion spans several paragraphs but is entirely devoted to explaining why privacy concerns do NOT justify restricting Cohen's speech in this public setting, distinguishing it from cases involving intrusion into the home. This is more of a 'negative principle' (explaining what the case is NOT about) rather than a principle with actual weight in the decision."

Free expression at 1.0 is clearly correct - this is quintessentially a First Amendment case striking down the CDA on speech grounds. The opinion excerpt explicitly states the statute 'abridges the freedom of speech protected by the First Amendment.' Equal protection at 0.0 and federalism at 0.0 are correct - these issues don't appear in the opinion. Privacy_liberty at 0.1 appropriately captures the minor references to parental autonomy and directing child-rearing, which provide context but aren't central to the holding. The only slight overweighting is due_process at 0.2, since the Court explicitly declined to reach Fifth Amendment due process and treated vagueness as a First Amendment overbreadth concern rather than independent procedural due process. A weight of 0.10-0.15 would better reflect that vagueness doctrine appears but is subsumed under free expression analysis."

The opinion invalidates \u00a713981 on BOTH Commerce Clause AND Section 5 grounds. The other principles (free expression, due process, privacy/liberty) are correctly weighted at 0.0 as they play no meaningful role in the analysis."

      "verification_notes": "The extracted weights are highly accurate. Gibbons v. Ogden is indeed a quintessential federalism case that established fundamental Commerce Clause doctrine. The opinion explicitly addresses: (1) the scope of federal commerce power versus state authority, (2) the exclusivity of congressional power to regulate interstate commerce, (3) the Supremacy Clause's application when state laws conflict with federal laws, and (4) the limits of state regulatory authority. The excerpt confirms these themes throughout - the case turns entirely on whether New York's grant of a steamboat monopoly violates the federal commerce power. The justification accurately captures the holding that commerce regulation 'is exclusively vested in Congress.' The zero weights for other principles are appropriate: there are no free expression issues, no equal protection analysis (pre-14th Amendment), no due process claims, and no privacy/liberty interests at stake. This is purely a structural federalism case about the division of power between state and federal governments regarding commercial regulation."

Falwell (1988)' but the opinion text is clearly from a North Carolina charitable solicitation case (likely Riley v. National Federation of the Blind or a related case). The justification for 'free_expression' correctly describes the actual opinion content (charitable solicitation and First Amendment scrutiny), but the justification references 'footnote 14' discussing equal protection that does not appear anywhere in the provided excerpt. This suggests either: (1) the wrong case caption was used, (2) the justifications were written for a different opinion, or (3) footnote 14 appears later in the opinion beyond the excerpt. The actual Hustler v. Falwell case involved parody/satire and emotional distress, not charitable solicitation. Given the opinion excerpt provided, free_expression should be 1.0 and equal_protection should be 0.0 unless evidence of that footnote exists elsewhere."

The opinion heavily emphasizes 'the fundamental right of parents to rear their children' and 'the interest of parents in the care, custody, and control of their children.' This is more than a secondary theme - it's the core liberty interest at stake. The weight should be higher, though it's appropriate that it remains lower than due_process since the liberty interest is the substance while due process is the analytical framework."

The opinion excerpt confirms: (1) Due process is the exclusive constitutional framework - no free expression, equal protection, or federalism issues are present; (2) The quoted justifications are accurate and appear in the text; (3) The case explicitly addresses parental rights as a fundamental liberty interest protected by substantive due process. The distinction between 'due_process' (0.95) and 'privacy_liberty' (0.7) appears to reflect that due process is the legal doctrine while privacy/liberty is the substantive right, which is a reasonable taxonomic choice. However, given how central the parental liberty interest is to the entire opinion, the gap between these weights could be smaller."

          "reason": "While privacy/liberty is extensively discussed, it's analyzed primarily to reject it. The weight of 0.6 suggests significant endorsement, but the Court firmly holds 'the asserted right to assistance in committing suicide is not a fundamental liberty interest.' The discussion is substantial but ultimately negative, distinguishing Casey and Cruzan rather than extending them. A weight around 0.5 better reflects: significant analytical attention but ultimate rejection."
        }

      "verification_notes": "The extraction is largely accurate. Due process at 0.95 is correct - the opinion explicitly states 'We begin, as we do in all due process cases' and the entire framework is substantive due process analysis. Equal protection at 0.1 is accurate - mentioned in procedural history but not reached by either the Ninth Circuit or Supreme Court. Free expression at 0.0 is correct - not discussed. The quoted justifications accurately reflect the opinion text. The main issue is that federalism deserves more weight given the extensive discussion of state law traditions and the conclusion's emphasis on preserving state policy-making authority."

The 1.0 anchor should be reserved for cases where literally nothing else matters."
        }

      "verification_notes": "The justifications are accurate - the quoted language appears in the opinion. The federalism weight of 1.0 is defensible given that the entire holding rests on Commerce Clause analysis. However, the case's context as a landmark civil rights decision means equal protection concerns (even if not formally decided) pervade the opinion more than 0.1 suggests. The opinion extensively discusses the history of civil rights legislation, discrimination in public accommodations, and the burden on Negro interstate travelers - all equal protection concerns addressed through the commerce power. The privacy_liberty weight of 0.1 is appropriate given the brief rejection of these claims."

      "verification_notes": "The equal_protection weight of 1.0 is entirely justified - this is the landmark case establishing intermediate scrutiny for gender classifications. The opinion excerpt confirms the case 'turns on Equal Protection analysis' with the critical language about gender classifications serving 'important governmental objectives' and being 'substantially related.' The free_expression and privacy_liberty weights of 0.0 are correct - these principles are not meaningfully discussed. The justification quotes are accurate and appear in the text. The federalism discussion, while present, serves primarily as a rejected defense rather than a core principle being developed, suggesting it might be slightly overweighted at 0.3."

The 'protects people, not places' language and 'justifiably relied' privacy language are verbatim. The due process justification accurately reflects the opinion's emphasis on warrant procedures and neutral magistrate interposition. The weights of 0.0 for free_expression, equal_protection, and federalism are correct - these principles are not addressed in the opinion. The relative weighting (privacy > due process) is appropriate, though both could be slightly increased given how thoroughly the opinion addresses these issues. The case is fundamentally about Fourth Amendment search/seizure doctrine, which implicates both privacy rights and procedural protections against unreasonable government intrusion."
