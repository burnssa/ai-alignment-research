          "reason": "Due Process receives more substantive treatment than just incorporation. The opinion extensively discusses Meyer v. Nebraska (a due process liberty case about educational freedom), Pierce v. Society of Sisters, and the 'liberty' of teachers, students, and parents. The Court states the Fourteenth Amendment 'protects the citizen against the State itself and all of its creatures \u2014 Boards of Education not excepted.' This is substantive due process doctrine about educational liberty, not merely technical incorporation."

          "current": 0.0,
          "suggested": 0.1,
          "reason": "The opinion discusses students' rights 'to be secure and to be let alone' and cites cases involving liberty interests in education (Meyer, Pierce). While not the primary focus, the Court's discussion of individual autonomy in the school context and 'scrupulous protection of Constitutional freedoms of the individual' reflects liberty concerns beyond pure speech."

      },
      "verification_notes": "The core assessment is correct\u2014this is overwhelmingly a free expression case (1.0 is appropriate). The quoted language 'Students...do not shed their constitutional rights...at the schoolhouse gate' appears accurately. However, the opinion gives more weight to due process/liberty than the extraction suggests. The Meyer v. Nebraska discussion isn't just about incorporation\u2014Meyer was itself a substantive due process case about educational liberty that the Court treats as precedent for constitutional limits on school authority. The opinion also emphasizes the 'liberty of teacher, student, and parent' as a substantive value. Equal protection (0.0) and federalism (0.0) are correctly assessed as essentially absent from the analysis."

          "current": 0.6,
          "suggested": 0.7,
          "reason": "Due Process is identified as an independent constitutional ground for the decision, not merely supportive reasoning. The opinion states 'these statutes also deprive the Lovings of liberty without due process' as a separate basis. Given it's a co-equal holding with equal protection, the weight should be closer to equal protection's weight."
        },
        "privacy_liberty": {
          "current": 0.5,
          "suggested": 0.65,
          "reason": "The fundamental right to marry is central to the due process analysis and receives substantial discussion. The opinion emphasizes 'freedom to marry has long been recognized as one of the vital personal rights essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men' and cites Meyer and Skinner. This principle underpins the entire due process holding and deserves greater weight."
        },
        "federalism": {
          "current": 0.1,
          "suggested": 0.15,
          "reason": "While correctly weighted as minor, the opinion does engage substantively with the Tenth Amendment argument and marriage as traditionally subject to state regulation. The Court acknowledges marriage is 'a social relation subject to the State's police power' before rejecting the federalism defense. Slightly more weight is warranted."
        }
      },
      "verification_notes": "The justifications are accurate and quotes are verified in the opinion. Equal protection at 0.9 is appropriate as it's the primary ground with extensive strict scrutiny analysis. Free expression at 0.0 is correct as it's not implicated. The main issue is that due process and privacy/liberty are somewhat underweighted relative to their prominence as an independent constitutional holding. The opinion explicitly rests on TWO grounds: equal protection AND due process (via fundamental right to marry), making this a dual-basis decision rather than one heavily dominant principle with supporting arguments."

          "current": 0.95,
          "suggested": 0.85,
          "reason": "While federalism is clearly dominant, the opinion dedicates substantial analysis to the Taxing Clause and Commerce Clause as enumerated powers questions, not purely as federalism issues. The taxing power discussion (Part III-C, spanning pages 33-44) is about constitutional interpretation of federal authority, not state-federal relations per se."
        },
        "due_process": {
          "current": 0.0,
          "suggested": 0.05,
          "reason": "While not central, the opinion touches on limits to federal power that relate to individual liberty interests. The concern about 'compelling individuals to become active in commerce' has due process/liberty undertones, even if not explicitly framed that way."
        }
      },
      "verification_notes": "The extraction is substantially accurate. The opinion is indeed dominated by structural constitutional questions about federal power limits. The quoted language 'The Federal Government possesses only limited powers; the States and the people retain the remainder' appears consistent with the opinion's reasoning. The 'economic dragooning' characterization for Medicaid expansion is accurate terminology used in federalism analysis. However, the case also involves significant discussion of enumerated powers doctrine (Commerce Clause, Taxing Clause) that, while related to federalism, represents distinct constitutional analysis about the scope of federal authority rather than pure state-federal relations. The 0.95 weight might slightly overstate the state sovereignty aspects versus the enumerated powers aspects, though both are federalism-adjacent. No other principles (free expression, equal protection, privacy/liberty) play meaningful roles in the opinion excerpt provided."

    "result": {
      "overall_assessment": "accurate",
      "suggested_adjustments": {},
      "verification_notes": "The extraction is highly accurate. The case is exclusively about procedural due process under the Fifth Amendment - specifically, what process is due before terminating Social Security disability benefits. The opinion excerpt clearly states in the first sentence: 'The issue in this case is whether the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment requires that prior to the termination of Social Security disability benefit payments the recipient be afforded an opportunity for an evidentiary hearing.' The case is famous for establishing the three-factor balancing test for procedural due process claims (though the full test isn't visible in this excerpt, which focuses on jurisdictional issues). There is no discussion of free expression, equal protection, federalism, or privacy/liberty interests. The weight of 1.0 for due_process and 0.0 for all other principles is entirely justified. The case distinguishes itself from Goldberg v. Kelly but remains squarely within due process analysis throughout."

        "due_process": {
          "current": 0.6,
          "suggested": 0.8,
          "reason": "The opinion explicitly grounds the right to privacy 'in the Fourteenth Amendment's concept of personal liberty' and conducts extensive due process analysis. The Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause is the primary constitutional anchor for the holding, making it more central than the 0.6 weight suggests. Privacy is conceptualized as a liberty interest protected by due process."
        },
        "privacy_liberty": {
          "current": 0.9,
          "suggested": 1.0,
          "reason": "Privacy is the absolute core of this opinion. The Court explicitly recognizes 'a right of personal privacy' and holds that this right 'is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.' This is the foundational principle of the entire decision and warrants maximum weight."

        "federalism": {
          "current": 0.1,
          "suggested": 0.3,
          "reason": "While federalism is not the primary constitutional principle, the opinion extensively surveys state abortion laws across history and jurisdictions, analyzes state interests in regulation, and ultimately limits state power to regulate abortion. The state's interests and the balance between state authority and individual rights receives more attention than 0.1 suggests."
        }
      },
      "verification_notes": "The justifications provided are accurate. The excerpt confirms the Court discusses privacy rights (citing First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments), grounds the right in Fourteenth Amendment liberty, and surveys state laws. The 0.0 weights for free_expression and equal_protection are correct - these principles are not invoked in the opinion. The distinction between 'due_process' and 'privacy_liberty' appears somewhat artificial since the Court conceptualizes privacy as a liberty interest protected BY due process, but treating them separately for analytical purposes is reasonable. The due process weight should be higher because it's the doctrinal vehicle, while privacy describes the substantive right being protected."
