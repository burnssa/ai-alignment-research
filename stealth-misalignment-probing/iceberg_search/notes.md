# Iceberg Search Journal

Append-only log of generation strategies tried. The agent writes to this file before and after each batch. This is where the "research" is — specific hypotheses, what the agent changed, what happened, what it concluded.

Format per batch:

```
## Batch N (short-tag)
**Hypothesis:** why this change should improve mean_conversion_score
**Changes to generator:** specific edits made to generate_prompts.py
**Result:** mean_cscore=X, dist=never/100/50/25/10, cost=$Y
**Interpretation:** what worked, what didn't, what to try next
```
